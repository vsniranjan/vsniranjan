### me  
i’m a cs student obsessed with how computers *actually* work.  
i spend way too much time tweaking configs, breaking things on purpose, and pretending it’s all part of the learning process.  

also, **i use arch btw** — customized to the point it barely boots sometimes :P  

i like building random projects, exploring system internals, and figuring out how code becomes reality.  
if you want to collab or just talk tech, reach out — i’m always down to nerd out about something.
